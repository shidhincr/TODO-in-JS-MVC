TODO-in-JS-MVC
==============

This is a sample TODO application project done in Javascript. I'm still trying to learn the MVC patterns in javascript and 
this is the first outcome of it.

For anyone , who wants to learn how to use the MVC patterns in Javascript can use this as a resource. I've implemented 
the "models" , "views" and "controllers" in simple Javascript ( means , I didn't use any clientside MVC framework available )

Try it out - Fork it if you want to.

You can see the demo here by following the link
